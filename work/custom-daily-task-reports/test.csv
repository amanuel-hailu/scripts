The course wasn't rolled out by the Nursing Professional Development and Brandi Alfred has no direct insight into when the course will be rolled out.
We will need to build in our schedule the creation of the report and prepare for it, but looks like there is a delay at the stakeholder level 🙂
(Just for reference purposes, contacts for Agnes to find information is Brandi Alfred and Brandi Alfred will ask Elizabeth Gonder claire.gonder@medstar.net about the rollouts.)"
