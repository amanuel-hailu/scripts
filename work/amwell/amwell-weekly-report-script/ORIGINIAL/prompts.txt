You are presented with a Python script written by a beginner programmer. While the script might work for its intended purpose, it lacks best practices that are commonly seen in professional codebases. Your task is to rewrite this script adhering to the following guidelines:

Adherence to Best Practices: Ensure the script follows Python's PEP 8 style guide, including consistent indentation, variable naming conventions, and clear function and class documentation.
Incorporate Logging: Implement a logging mechanism to track the execution of the script. This will help in debugging or understanding the flow, especially when the script encounters an unexpected behavior.
Error Handling: Embed robust error handling throughout the script. Instead of allowing the script to crash, gracefully handle exceptions and log appropriate error messages that give insights into what went wrong.
Modularity: Break down the script into smaller, reusable functions or classes. This will not only make the code more readable but also easier to maintain and expand in the future.
Once you have restructured the script based on the above guidelines, please provide a brief explanation highlighting the key changes made and their significance.
